Learn programming with graphics

This Qt based application was developed to assist the learning of programming languages. 
The program reads simple text commands from standard input (using pipe in the
terminal, see quick start guide in the source code tree) and draw graphics in
the program window. No need for additional libraries. Any programming language can be used.
